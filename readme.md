Hey Everyone,

I went ahead and re-did this code test and fixed some pretty large OOP issues with my first answer and also added testing to my repo. you can run the projects anyway you'd like. It is created using .NET6 so keep that in mind when running the projects.

I use the terminal for everything since it allow for greater automation in workflow. This allows me to run the project using an npm package called 'nodemon'. To install nodemon you need NodeJS installed. Once that is installed you can install nodemon globally using the command 'npm i -g nodemon'. From there you can run the project from the root directory using either the command 'd'(short for dev) or 't'(short for test) with npm run(ex npm run d) in the terminal. I personally recommend using WSL2 with Ubuntu to install these tools and run the commands but Powershell will work fine too, just a bit slower. Alternatively you can navigate to each project folder and run the commands there or run them the old fashioned way. Everything also works in Visual Studio 2022 Community Version. I confirmed that myself for both the 'src' project and thest 'tests' project, so no problems there. I know you guys are huge advocates for VS over vscode so I had to make sure that everything was in order.

Hopefully me pinging you all with another email isn't causing any distractions or inconveniences in your work day considering you probably have many candidates to vet and attend too. Let me know what you think if you get the chance. Overall I feel much more confidend with C# now. Thank you for the project, it really helped me learned something new.

Thanks for your time,

Matt Mannion

TLDR: I fixed OOP mistakes, added tests, and added nodemon for reloading.
